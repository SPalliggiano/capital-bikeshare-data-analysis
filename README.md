# Capital Bikeshare Data Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains the analysis of bike rides undertaken by users of Capital Bikeshare (CaBi), which is a publicly-owned bicycle sharing system that serves areas in and around Washington DC in the United States. The license under which the datasets are made available can be found at https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/data-license-agreement.

The analysis covers data collected between January 2019 and July 2020 inclusive, and it was carried out using the R programming language and tidyverse packages.
